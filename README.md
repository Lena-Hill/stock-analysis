# stock-analysis
Our objective for the VBA challenge was to create a VBA script that would loop through stock market data, thereby making analysis easier, faster, and accurate. We were given stock data for three years (2018-20) with the following data points: ticker symbol, date, opening price, high price, low price, closing price, and volume. By using a VBA script we were able to see yearly change in stock price, percent change, and total stock volume, all sorted into ticker symbols. We were then asked to create functionality in our data by using a VBA script to calculate greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume. I was able to do this on the practice sheet, but I must have missed something bringing the code over to the full data set. I cant seem to find the problem and I'm too afraid of breaking all my code to experiment with it any longer. But if my code wasn't broken, that information would be there. 

Where I got help with this code: 
Line 6-10. Github https://github.com/ibaloyan/Stock_Analysis_with_VBA. I used several lines of code from this user: line 47-48, 58, 72, and 91. I used some of this code to set up headers across all sheets and to check my math. 
Line 85 came from a forum on Stack Overflow. I couldnt figure out how to insert data in the ticker name, and this worked. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77118851/how-do-i-get-the-largest-percent-change-with-the-corresponding-ticker-using-if-s
